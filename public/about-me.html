    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Vedant Ramgade, 20 years old, currently pursuing a BSc degree at Walchand College of Arts and Science in Solapur. While I’m focusing on my academics, I’ve also developed a strong passion for web development. I’m working toward becoming a full-stack developer because I enjoy the challenge of building both the front-end and back-end of websites. Additionally, I’ve grown fascinated by Web3 and blockchain technology. I believe these technologies are the future of the internet, and I’m excited to be part of that evolution. So far, I’ve created a few small projects to hone my skills, including cloning the Google web page, and I’m always on the lookout for more ways to improve.</p>
    
    <p>One of the people who inspire me the most is Elon Musk. His passion and dedication to his work are what set him apart, and I admire how he relentlessly pursues his goals no matter the obstacles. This mindset pushes me to stay motivated and continue working on my projects. I aspire to have the same kind of impact in my own field, contributing to groundbreaking innovations, especially in the areas of Web3 and blockchain. It’s not just about success for me but also about making a meaningful difference through the work I do.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of technology, I have a few other interests that keep me balanced. I love trying out different foods—there’s something exciting about experiencing new flavors from various cuisines. Traveling is another thing I enjoy, though I prefer doing it with my friends or family because those shared memories make the trips more meaningful. When I’m not coding or exploring new places, I unwind by watching stand-up comedy. There’s something about the humor that connects people, and it’s a big dream of mine to attend a live show someday and experience that energy firsthand. It’s these small joys, combined with my tech ambitions, that keep me grounded and motivated in life.</p>
